1. Install the latest version of Auctionator and Collectionator from your addon
   manager.

2. Go to the "Collecting" tab

3. Click the "Scan" button

Installing from git
===================
You will need to run `./GetRecipesToSpellIDs/do-all.sh` in the checkout
directory to get the recipe IDs placed in the file
`./Collectionator/Data/RecipesToSpellIDs.lua`

You can run the addon without the file, but you will likely get an error.
